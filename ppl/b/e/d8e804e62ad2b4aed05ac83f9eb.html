				Jewell County, Cutlers History of Kansas 1883<br />
				ISAAC NEES, farmer, of Brown's Creek Township, P. O. Jewell City, was born in Venango County, Pa. Removed to Warren County, Ill. Came to Jewell County, Kan., in 1871, and took a homestead twelve miles southwest of Mankato, and is now the owner of 560 acres of land; keeps eighty head of cattle and fifty head of hogs. Mr. Nees' farm is one of the best in Jewell County, and may be called the model farm of said county. He has each forty acres fenced with hedge, and has splendid improvements. Is a member of the Odd Fellows fraternity. He was married, November 20, 1864, near Havana. Ill., to Miss Sarah A. Edkins, and is the father of ten children.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC DIAMOND, 29 Apr 1876, PG 3: Isaac Nees, on Brown's creek, has 400 acres of choice prairie land, 100 of which is under cultivation and 8 planted to forest trees. He has 7 miles of osage hedge some of which already turns stock. He has 44 acres in small grain and will plant 55 to corn leaving an acre for potatoes and garden. He has 21 head of cattle and a fine lot of hogs; a house which cost $600 cash besides labor, a large amount of improved farm machinery; growing orchards &amp;c. &amp;c. all from a start of $2,000 which he brought to the county four years ago. We forgot to ask Mr. Nees how many thousand bushels of corn and wheat he has stored away.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN 5 MAY 1882, BROWN'S CREEK TWP: (WRITTEN BY CORRESPONDENT)<br />
				Isaac Nees, one of the largest land owners in Brown's Creek township, is located and has his improvements in Sec. 5; owns the north half of said section, 160 acres in Sec 32, T.4, R. 8, and 80 acres in Sec. 6, T. 5 R. 9, altogether 560 acres. It would be a big job to give a detailed account of all we saw on this monster farm. Of course he farms on a large scale; has lots of mule power and stacks of machinery with which to carry on his farming operations, has large droves of cattle and hogs to eat, when the proper time comes, the mountains of corn that he raises. Has roomy, comfortable stables, large and secure feed lots and corrals and well enclosed pastures. His hedges, which are second to none in the county, he counts by the mile, and his forest trees which are the largest and most thrifty, for their age, that we have yet seen during our wanderings, he numbers by the thousands; has fruit of all kinds and of the choicest varieties in abundance. His crop ventures this year are 60 acres of broom corn, 175 acres of corn, and six acres of cane, mostly planted, used the lister, and is not backward in saying that it is just the thing. Our stay with Mr. Nees was prolonged by request until after dinner, a kindness duly appreciated.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC MONITOR, 1 JUN 1887, BROWN'S CREEK TWP: From here we went across the road east, to the fine 640 farm owned by Isaac Nees, 160 acres of which he homesteaded in '71. He came here with a large family and about $1,000. He farms 400 acres, the balance of the farm being in orchard and pasture. He has eight acres of grove and a fine bearing orchard, and small fruit in abundance. He has picked from 25 to 50 bushels of wild currants in a season, he has 18 acres of orchard grass and clover, his house is, main part 16x32, two stories, with L 16x26 with 10 foot porches, also good and substantial out-buildings. We saw in his yards 79 steers, 200 hogs, 40 stock cattle and 12 horses and mules. He considers his farm worth $20 an acre.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC MONITOR, 16 APR 1903, Paradise items, pg 5: A surprise is planned for Isaac Nees on the 16th, six miles southwest of Jewell. These surprises occur surprisingly often for the season of the year.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 08 APR 1904, Front page: Nineteen of Isaac Nees' grandchildren had measles all at one time, but we do not want you to think that is all the grandchildren Isaac has.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 07 OCT 1904, Front page: A crowd of Ionia and Brown's Creek folks started for the fair (1904 World Fair in St. Louis, MO.) Tuesday. We caught the following names: Otis Miller, Perry Alcorn and wife, J.L. Alcorn and wife, J.M. Baggott and wife, Miss Minnie Merrill, Henry Mullin, L.C. Addington, Mrs. W.B. White, Flora Hutchison, J.W. Meadows and daughter, Miss Luella Duncanson, W.R. Stikler and wife, Isaac Nees, Charles Meeker and wife.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 07 APR 1905, Brown's Creek items, pg 5: Mr. Nees has been staying at Mr. Wallace's several days, taking care of his son (Cyrus) since he got hurt.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 16 JUN 1905, From the Mankato ADVERTISER, pg 5: Uncle Isaac Nees of Brown's Creek was in town today on business. Mr. Nees came to Jewell county and homesteaded his present home August 22, '71 and moved there February 4, '72 and has lived there ever since. Mr. Nees says that all the members of his family have not been off the place at one time since they moved there.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 14 JUL 1905, Brown's Creek items, pg 5: Isaac Nees is using about 20,000 new shingles on his big cattle sheds.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 30 MAR 1906, Neighboring Counties, PG 4: Mr. Isaac Nees, visited last week in this city with his brother-in-law D.A. Atkins. The two gentlemen came to Kansas about the same time, in 1871, and settled in northern Jewell county. Mr. Nees bringing money with him began immediately to prosper and is now one of the wealthy farmers of his locality. -- Cawker RECORD.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC ADVERTISER, 08 JUN 1905, pg 5: Uncle Isaac Nees of Browns creek was in town to lay on business. Mr. Nees came to Jewell county and homesteaded his present home August 22, '71 and moved there February 4, '72 and has lived there every since. Mr. Nees says that all the members of his family have not been off the place at one time since they moved there.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 13 JUL 1906, pg 12: Isaac Nees is still considerably crippled on account of stepping on a nail several weeks ago. The wound has healed but whenever he uses the foot it makes him lame.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 23 AUG 1907, Brown's Creek items, pg 8: Mr. Isaac Nees has had concrete coping put around his lots in the Union cemetery.<br />
				JC REPUBLICAN, 06 MAR 1908, PG 8: Isaac Nees says that when he owned his first 80 acres of land and had it all paid for and had a couple of cows and things comfortable, he felt as rich as he ever has since; and was as happy and contented. He now owns over eleven hundred acres of Jewell county land and has much other property to look after; and he can't wear any more nor eat any more or have any better time than he had when his income was just enough to make him a good living. Poor people have a notion that wealth is most everything, but people who have wealth know that if they are happy it is something besides wealth that makes them so.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 31 DEC 1909, Front page: Isaac Nees takes considerable pains to keep count of his grandchildren. The last inventory showed 36.
				</p>

				JC REPUBLICAN, 04 AUG 1916, Brown's Creek items, pg 8: We were somewhat surprised when we heard our pioneer neighbor of over 40 years, Isaac Nees, had sold his home place and was going to move to town. The family will be greatly missed in this community in many ways, but we think they have earned a rest, and hope they will enjoy their new home.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 13 OCT 1916, Front page; Isaac Nees and his granddaughter, Miss Fleda George, are now occupying their new home in town.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 03 NOV 1916, pg 8: Isaac Nees can't live in town without making something move, so he has built a garage and is painting his residence.
				</p>
				<p>
				JC REPUBLICAN, 17 JAN 1919, Front page: Isaac Nees: I have 36 grandchildren.<br />
